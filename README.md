# ELUTENG-SSD-Adapter-Case
After getting an [external SSD adapter](https://www.amazon.com/ELUTENG-M-2-USB-Converter-Enclosure/dp/B0CQ8FLYWF?th=1), I decided, why not make a case for it! So after some light CAD word with my calipers, I had not only an accurate model of the SSD + adapter, but had also made a case for it as well.

Now, I can carry this SSD anywhere I need! I put the storage size on the side, but that can be easily modified to whatever SSD I put in it. Right now, I have a 512 GB SSD in here!

NOTE: This model requires 2 heat-set inserts (M3) and 2 M3x8 SHCS
